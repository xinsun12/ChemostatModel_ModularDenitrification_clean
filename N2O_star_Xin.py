def N2O_star(loss, Qc, diam, dc_n2o, y_n5N2O_C, K):
    '''
    Calculates the subsistence O2 concentration required to sustain biomass at equilibrium

    Parameters
    ----------
    loss : Float
        rate at which biomass is lost (1 / day)
    Qc : TYPE
        carbon quota of a single cell (mol C / um^3)
    diam : Float
        equivalent spherical diatmeter of the microbe (um)
    dc_n2o : Float
        rate of diffusive N2O supply (m^2 / day)
    y_n5N2O_C = y_n5N2O * CN_den: 
        yield of biomass per unit N-N2O consumed (mol C-biomass/ mol N-N2O)
    K: 
        half saturation constant of N2O in the unit of ÂµM-N-N2O (K_n2o_Den)

    Returns
    -------
    Float
        Subsistence N2O concentration (in nM? since * 1e-9 is uM = mmol/m3)
