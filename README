An idealized OMZ ecosystem model

	1. model.py is the model
 	2. traits.py contains model parameters for traits of different microbial functional groups and their references
	3. call_model_nopulse.py and call_model_pulse.py are used to run models without and with organic matter pulses, respectively
 	4. The files ended with star_Xin.py contain functions to calculate different R*

The metabolic model and Flux Balance Analysis
	1. D2M19.xml is the curated metabolic model of Marinobacteria.
 	2. yOM_denitrifier_steps.ipynb contains scripts of Flux Balance Analysis using different media.
